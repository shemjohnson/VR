The folders ending in "Build" are the final builds, the rest is source code. We were unsure how to avoid including "Unity metadata" and hope that it isn't too inconvenient. We also hope that there are no issues running the experiences on Rift, which may occur because we used a newer version of the Oculus software than that in the assignment description. We don't expect this to be a problem.

Also, we performed the extra credit portions of Part 2 and Part 3.

We have all contributed to this code in an equitable manner and agree that, to the best
 of our knowledge, it accurately represents our understanding for the assignment.
